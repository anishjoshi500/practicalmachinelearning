## Practical Machine Learning - Coursera Course Project

### Background

Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, your goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from the website here: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset).

## Project Report

### Data Loading & Cleaning

First we need to load all the libraries we will be using in our code and set seed as follows

    library(caret)
    library(randomForest)
    library(rattle)
    library(rpart)
    library(rpart.plot)
    set.seed(123)
Data Loading

    train_csv <- read.csv("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv")
    test_csv <- read.csv("http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv")

Check dimensions

    dim(train_csv)
    dim(test_csv)
    
    [1] 19622   160
    [1]  20 160
    
Data Cleaning

Removing all the columns with missing values

    train_csv_clean <- train_csv[,colSums(is.na(train_csv)) == 0]
    test_csv_clean <- test_csv[,colSums(is.na(test_csv)) == 0]

Again checking the dimensions

    dim(train_csv_clean)
    dim(test_csv_clean)

    [1] 19622    93
    [1] 20 60

Deleting variables which are irrelevant and not important in predicting the output

    train_csv_final_clean <- train_csv_clean[,-c(1:7)]
    test_csv_final_clean <- test_csv_clean[,-c(1:7)]
    x<-names(train_csv_final_clean) %in% c("skewness_roll_belt", "skewness_roll_belt.1", "skewness_yaw_belt",
    "max_yaw_belt", "kurtosis_picth_dumbbell", "kurtosis_yaw_dumbbell", "skewness_roll_dumbbell",
    "skewness_pitch_dumbbell", "skewness_yaw_dumbbell", "max_yaw_dumbbell", "min_yaw_dumbbell",
    "amplitude_yaw_dumbbell", "kurtosis_roll_forearm", "kurtosis_picth_forearm", "kurtosis_yaw_forearm",
    "skewness_roll_forearm", "skewness_pitch_forearm", "skewness_yaw_forearm", "max_roll_forearm",
    "max_yaw_forearm", "min_roll_forearm", "min_yaw_belt", "amplitude_yaw_belt", "avg_roll_arm", "stddev_roll_arm",
    "var_roll_arm", "avg_pitch_arm", "stddev_pitch_arm", "var_pitch_arm", "avg_yaw_arm",
    "stddev_yaw_arm", "avg_roll_forearm", "stddev_roll_forearm", "var_roll_forearm",
    "avg_pitch_forearm", "stddev_pitch_forearm", "var_pitch_forearm", "avg_yaw_forearm",
    "stddev_yaw_forearm", "var_yaw_forearm", "var_yaw_arm", "kurtosis_roll_arm", "kurtosis_picth_arm",
    "kurtosis_yaw_arm", "skewness_roll_arm", "skewness_pitch_arm", "skewness_yaw_arm",
    "max_roll_arm", "min_roll_arm", "kurtosis_roll_belt", "kurtosis_picth_belt",
    "kurtosis_yaw_belt", "min_pitch_arm", "amplitude_roll_arm", "amplitude_pitch_arm",
    "kurtosis_roll_dumbbell", "min_yaw_forearm", "amplitude_roll_forearm",
    "amplitude_yaw_forearm")
    train_csv_final_clean<-train_csv_final_clean[!x]


### Data Partioning

Partioning the data into 60% training set and 40% test set as follows

    trainer<- createDataPartition(y=train_csv_final_clean$classe, p=0.60, list=FALSE)
    final_train<- train_csv_final_clean[trainer, ]
    final_test<- train_csv_final_clean[-trainer, ]

### Applying Prediction Algorithms
We will be using two prediction models namely the Random Forest Model and the Decision Tree Model as follows

Random forest

    model <- randomForest(classe ~., data=final_train, method="class")
    predict_model <- predict(model, final_test, type = "class")
    confusionMatrix(predict_model, final_test$classe)

Output of the Confusion Matrix for Random Forest

The Random Forest Algorithm gives us better accuracy of 0.9944 compared to the Decision Trees Algorithm whose accuracy is just 0.774 thus for prediction we will be using the Random Forest Algorithm.

### Prediction and Output File Generation

Prediction using Random Forest Algorithm as follows

    final_prediction <- predict(model, test_csv, type = "class")
    print(final_prediction)

Output of Final Prediction

    1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 
    B  A  B  A  A  E  D  B  A  A  B  C  B  A  E  E  A  B  B  B 
    Levels: A B C D E

Writing Prediction Output to Files

    pmlwrite = function(temp){
    n = length(temp)
    for(i in 1:n){
      filename = paste0("problem-id_",i,".txt")
      write.table(temp[i],file=filename,quote=FALSE,row.names=FALSE,col.names=FALSE)
     }
    }
    pmlwrite(final_prediction)
